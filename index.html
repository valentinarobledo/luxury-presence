                  Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more difficult to do with a written description.

                  However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.</p>
